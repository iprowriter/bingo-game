**REASONS FOR USING TECHNOLOGIES MENTIONED ABOVE**
1. [React](https://reactjs.org/) is the dependable library. It is suitable for this project because it is fast and no SEO required. 
In case SEO is required fo this project, then it will be better to switch to [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/).
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) used in this code to enforce type.
3. [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) (MUI) is an easy CSS framework that works perfectly with react. 
Another good option to consider in place of TypeScript is Tailwind Css.
4. [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) allowed the use of normal CSS  in MUI.
5. Some of the components feature could not be achieved using MUI. Therefore, it was necessary to use bare-boned CSS at some point.
6. [React-Use](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use) was used in this project to be able to access with window object and used it with a library called React-Confetti.
7. [React-Confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-confetti) is a lightweight CSS library for achieving confetti effect on react projects. It was used in this project to display Confetti effect when a player wins the game.
8. [Unicode-Emoji](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) was also used to make the data a lit bit more colorful 
9. [Render](render.com) platform was used as an alternative to Heroku in the deployment of this project. Click this link to view the live version of the game: [Bing-game-live-version](https://bingo-game-gcnn.onrender.com)
